# Layer groups

Layer groups are a collection of layers already published in GeoServer, which are requested together for only one layer. [(see chapter 3.2)](../ui/data/index.html#group-layer)

**Task:**

1. Create a new layer group with different individual layers of your choice.

2. Edit the layer hierarchy. Surface layers (e.g. administrative areas or satellite data) should be displayed in the background and smaller units (streets, towns or rivers) in the foreground.

3. Publish the layer group.
